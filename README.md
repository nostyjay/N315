##Jungle Cook##

## DESCRIPTION:
## Jungle cook is a CRUD application fitted to work on both personal computers
## and mobile devices. Jungle Cook allows users to search other users' recipes,
## create their own, delete them, and update them to form the perfect recipe!
##
## USABILITY DETAILS:
## -- Sign up does not currently work, to sign in, simply use admin as the username and password
## -- edit recipe works, but is bugged. Exercise caution when editing recipes
## -- The site is currently only a template and has NO storage implementation
## -- RECIPES WILL RESET ON PAGE RELOAD
##
## TBD:
## -- Storage implementation to keep users and recipes on reload
## -- Signup implementation
## -- Bug fixes
## -- Correct Edit page functionalities
